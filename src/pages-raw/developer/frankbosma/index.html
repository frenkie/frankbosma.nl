        <p>
            The code and frontend setup of this website is available on
            <a href="https://github.com/frenkie/frankbosma.nl">Github</a>. It uses quite some
            stuff that I wanted to check out for automated site content and code generation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4">Build tool / task automation</h2>
        <p>
            To handle webpage generation, dependency management, SASS -&gt; CSS translation,
            minification of CSS and JavaScript, image creation and maintain a development server
            that refreshes the site automatically with every change, I started using
            <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. It let's me do all the build steps individually
            or in parallel so I can have an install task that creates a production ready version of the site
            with one command.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4">CMS</h2>
        <p>
            I use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> as a website / pages generator. Jekyll
            let's you easily generate webpages with Markdown or HTML and a templating language.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4">Responsiveness</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="responsivebp.com">Responsive</a> SASS framework is included as a
            <a  href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule">Git submodule</a>. I only
            use it's simple responsive grid mixins. Compared to Bootstrap it doesn't add the visual
            styles and it's easy to just use parts of it through SASS. The submodule system
            allows me to not have to include the entire framework in my repository and to
            easily benefit from updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            For responsive images I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill">&lt;picture&gt; polyfill</a> and
            through reading <a href="http://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/"></a> I've noticed that with a combination of <code>srcset</code> and
            <code>sizes</code> attributes you get the best responsive image results. Images are
            then chosen based on viewport size, screen resolution and the width of the image component.
        </p>
        <p>
            The different image sizes are generated from a source file through the
            <a href="">gulp-image-resize</a> plugin that's talking
            to <a href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/">GraphicsMagick</a> or
            <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4">JavaScript dependencies</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a> is working excellent as a frontend dependency
            manager to download all the right versions of external JavaScript files like html5shiv or
            the &lt;picture&gt; polyfill.
