        <p>Everybody loves playing outside. <a href="http://figurerunning.com/">FigureRunning</a> is a new sport that encourages you to get creative, go outside and discover new places while running and getting fit. The competition is not about your running speed or distance, itâ€™s all about drawing with their mobile app and GPS.</p>

        <p>I created the <a href="http://figurerunning.com/">online gallery</a> alongside their mobile apps, where you can browse and search FigureRuns. It renders colored line data from FigureRuns on a Google Map.</p>
        <p>
            <em>The world is your canvas and you are the pencil</em> is FigureRunning's slogan and I couldn't agree more.
