            WaveRider is a 3D browser game that let's you ride your own music. <br />
            Your goal is to make it until the end of the song without falling behind, by riding a song's waveform.

            The game was made during a music hackday event and in it's current form it's not at all difficult to play :)<br />
            My goal is to expand this game with enemies and puzzles based on an analysis of the played music.
            Because game level difficulties are completely based on your sound input this could be a very fun game to play.
