        <h1>VPRO</h1>

        <p>
            I have been working in a small developer team at Dutch public broadcaster <a href="https://www.vpro.nl/">VPRO</a>
            since 2007. As a broadcaster our sites are mostly concerned with audio and video.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides websites we are currently working on a mobile web app for VPRO's internationally renowned music platform
            <a href="https://3voor12.vpro.nl">3VOOR12</a> as a replacement of it's iPhone and Android native app.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the past years I have done a lot of projects, but a recent VPRO project where I have been
            main responsible as a frontender, is the <a href="https://www.vpro.nl/">VPRO website</a>.
            It is a mobile first responsive site that makes use of responsive (background) images and touch
            sensitive sliders.
        </p>
        <p>
            The site is also used as a template for 2 other sites, the main site of broadcaster <a href="https://www.human.nl/">HUMAN</a> and of documentary platform <a href="http://www.npodoc.nl/">NPO Doc</a>. There is no
            code difference, only a differently configured stylesheet, and some CMS adjustable code configuration to
            make components behave differently, and still each has it's own identity.
