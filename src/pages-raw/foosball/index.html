           Together with my friends Anne van der Meer and Andre Heidema I started <a href="https://www.clubfoos.com">Club Foos</a> in 2012, a network of <a href="https://www.table-soccer.org">ITSF</a> oriented table soccer clubs. We currently have a club in Amsterdam and Rotterdam.

        <p>Table soccer, or foosball as the Americans say, is a great game that's loved by everybody, of any social class. There used to be Million Dollar tours back in the 70's, but currently it's not that well known as a sport any more. So that's where we come in ;) Not only highlighting the athletic side, but especially the social side.</p>
        <p>
            My biggest part in all of this is taking care of the websites, tournament software, poster and t-shirt designs.
